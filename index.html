    <section class="about">
      <p>Design is about communicating an idea. To be *a good designer, you have to *be a good communicator. That's why when I started at the University of South Carolina Aiken four years ago, I decided to get my degree in Communications with a minor in Studio Art. It has allowed me to build upon the design skills I already had while learning how to be a better communicator in the process.</p>
      <p>In my free time while at University, I've designed a <a href="http://www.productivityist.com/workbook">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.productivityist.com/shop/the-now-year-ebook">books</a>, <a href="http://beyondpixels.tv/">websites</a> and the look and feel of a <a href="http://www.usca.edu/cca2012/">conference</a>, among other things. In all of my work, I've tried my best to communication to people through simplicity. It is the hallmark of both my design and my philosophy.</p>
